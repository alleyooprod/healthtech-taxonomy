You are conducting a thorough review of a market taxonomy used for categorizing companies in the health, insurance, employee benefits, and wellness space.

CURRENT TAXONOMY (categories with company counts):
{taxonomy_tree}

ALL COMPANIES CURRENTLY IN THE TAXONOMY:
{all_companies}

Total companies: {total_companies}

TASK:
Perform a comprehensive review of the entire taxonomy structure. This is an infrequent, deep review — not a small incremental update. Consider:

1. Are companies in the RIGHT categories? List any that should be moved (type: "move", with from_category and to_category).
2. Should any categories be MERGED because they overlap too much?
3. Should any categories be SPLIT because they're too broad or contain distinct sub-themes?
4. Should any categories be RENAMED to better reflect their actual scope?
5. Are there missing categories that would better organize existing companies?
6. Should any subcategories be created for better granularity?

CHANGE TYPES:
- "add": A new top-level category is needed
- "merge": Two categories overlap significantly and should be combined
- "split": One category is too broad and should become multiple categories
- "rename": A category name doesn't capture its scope
- "add_subcategory": Create a subcategory under an existing category
- "move": Move a company from one category to another (use category_name for the company name, merge_into for target category)

RULES:
- Be specific about WHY each change improves the taxonomy
- For moves, list the company name in category_name and the target category in merge_into
- Only propose changes with clear justification — not changes for the sake of change
- Consider the taxonomy from the perspective of a product researcher analyzing the market for an insurance/health benefits product
- Subcategories are lightweight — add freely where they improve clarity
- Top-level changes should be well-justified
