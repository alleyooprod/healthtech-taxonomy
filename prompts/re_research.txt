You are updating research on a company using additional source links. The company has already been researched, and you are now enriching the data with new sources.

EXISTING RESEARCH:
{existing_research}

ADDITIONAL SOURCE URLS TO INVESTIGATE:
{source_urls}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Fetch each of the additional source URLs using WebFetch
2. For each URL, also navigate to relevant subpages (about, products, pricing, etc.) if applicable
3. Search the web for the company name + any new information discovered from the additional sources
4. Compare the new information against the existing research
5. Update any fields where the new sources provide more accurate, detailed, or current information
6. Keep existing information that is still accurate — don't lose good data

OUTPUT RULES:
- Return the COMPLETE updated research, not just the changes
- If a field's data improves from the new sources, update it with the richer information
- If the existing data is already accurate and complete, keep it as-is
- Confidence should increase if new sources corroborate existing data (up to 1.0)
- Confidence should reflect the total quality of all sources combined
- Minimum 3 sentences for 'what', 2 sentences for 'products'
- NEVER return placeholder text like "Various products" or "Multiple markets"

Extract these fields with the specified depth:

- name: Exact company name as they brand themselves
