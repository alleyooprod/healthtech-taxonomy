You are classifying a company into a market taxonomy covering health, insurance, employee benefits, HR platforms, wellness, wearables, and adjacent digital/physical services.

COMPANY RESEARCH DATA:
{company_json}

CURRENT TAXONOMY (categories with company counts):
{taxonomy_tree}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Based on the company's description, products, and target market, assign it to the BEST matching category from the taxonomy above.
2. If no existing category is a good fit, you may propose a new category name — but only if the company truly doesn't belong in any existing category.
3. Assign a subcategory (either an existing one or create a specific one).
4. Provide a confidence score (0.0-1.0) for how well this company fits the assigned category.

RULES:
- Prefer existing categories when the fit is reasonable (>60% match)
- Only propose new categories for truly novel company types
- Subcategories should be specific (e.g., "At-Home Blood Testing" not just "Testing")
- If the company spans multiple categories, pick the PRIMARY one based on their core revenue/product
- If the company is genuinely OUT OF SCOPE (not related to health, insurance, employee benefits, HR, wellness, or any adjacent market), set "skip": true and explain why. Only skip if the company truly does not belong — err on the side of including and proposing a new category
