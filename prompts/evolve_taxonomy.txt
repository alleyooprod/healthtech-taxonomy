You are reviewing and evolving a market taxonomy covering health, insurance, employee benefits, HR platforms, wellness, wearables, and adjacent services.

CURRENT TAXONOMY (categories with company counts):
{taxonomy_tree}

NEWLY PROCESSED COMPANIES IN THIS BATCH:
{new_companies}

FULL COMPANY LIST SUMMARY:
Total companies: {total_companies}

INSTRUCTIONS:
Review the taxonomy in light of the new data and propose changes if warranted.

CHANGE TYPES:
- "add": A new category is needed because 3+ companies don't fit existing categories well
- "merge": Two categories overlap significantly and should be combined
- "split": One category has become too broad (8+ companies with distinct sub-themes)
- "rename": A category name no longer captures its actual scope
- "add_subcategory": Create a subcategory under an existing category for better organization

RULES:
- Only propose changes when evidence is clear — at minimum 3 companies supporting the change
- Prefer stability over churn — don't restructure unless it meaningfully improves clarity
- Consider the taxonomy from the perspective of an insurance product researcher
- Subcategories are lightweight and can be added freely
- Top-level category changes (add, merge, split) should be conservative
- If no changes are needed, set no_changes_needed to true and explain why in the analysis
